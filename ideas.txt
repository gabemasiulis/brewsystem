for setting the timer via the "set" menu option - 
- http://zetcode.com/wxpython/tips/ for reference
- create a EVT_MENU binding for a new frame. - DONE
- use .Show() in a new method perhaps SetFrame()? to open the new window/frame - DONE
- make the new frame seperate class? - DONE
- spinCtrl boxes for MN and Sec - DONE
- Save button to bind those values to timer.Set() method - DONE

- should you be able to populate it from a beer.xml file?

for incoororating hop additions via beer.xml file
- boil sub class for timer.py
- pop up dialog with hop type/amt at apporoproate time
- audible alert?

general cleanup - 
- add backbround color to Frame - DONE
- remove fitemTwo from the first EVT_MENU biniding - DONE
- create OnRefresh method for common clearing/redrawing/rebinding that happens in several places - DONE
- add 00:00 timer check to OnRunning() method (stop the wxtimer) -DONE

future - 
- layout elements with grid sizers

### new idea ###
- create Timer() object globally - DONE
