for setting the timer via the "set" menu option - 
- create a EVT_MENU binding for a new frame.
- use .Show() to open the new window/frame
- make the new frame seperate class?
- txtCtrl boxes for MN and Sec
- Save button to bind those values to timer.Set() method
- cancel button
- limit range for sec to 0-60?
- http://zetcode.com/wxpython/tips/ for reference
- should you be able to populate it from a beer.xml file?

for incoororating hop additions via beer.xml file
- boil sub class for timer.py
- pop up dialog with hop type/amt at apporoproate time
- audible alert?

general cleanup - 
- add backbround color to Frame
- remove fitemTwo from the firste EVT_MENU biniding
- create OnRefresh mehod for common clearing/redrawing/rebinding that happens in several places
- add 00:00 timer check to OnRunning() method (stop the wxtimer)

future - 
- layout elements with grid sizers
